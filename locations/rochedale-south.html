      Once we launch, our goal is simple: make clearing out your junk feel easy, respectful and stress-free.

    <p>
      Whether it’s a full garage cleanout, a pile of old furniture, green waste from the yard or a couple of bulky items you just want gone — RedBack will be the crew you call when you want it done properly.
    </p>

  <!-- HOW IT WILL WORK -->
  <section class="how-it-works-suburb">
    <h2>How RedBack Will Work in Rochedale South</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>You show us the pile</strong> — we’ll offer simple, upfront pricing based on volume and access.</li>
      <li><strong>We load everything for you</strong> — from inside, outside or upstairs. You don’t lift a thing.</li>
      <li><strong>We sweep up</strong> — we leave the space tidy so you can enjoy your garage, yard or spare room again.</li>
      <li><strong>We handle disposal</strong> — we sort, recycle where possible and dispose of the rest responsibly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Until launch, we’re in setup mode — building the trailer, signage and systems so everything runs smoothly from day one.
